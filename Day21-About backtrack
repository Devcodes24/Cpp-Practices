When to Use a Backtracking Algorithm?

There are the following scenarios in which you can use the backtracking:

It is used to solve a variety of problems. You can use it, for example, to find a feasible solution to a decision problem.
Backtracking algorithms were also discovered to be very effective for solving optimization problems.
In some cases, it is used to find all feasible solutions to the enumeration problem.
Backtracking, on the other hand, is not regarded as an optimal problem-solving technique. It is useful when the solution to a problem does not have a time limit.
Following an example of a backtracking algorithm, you will now look at different types.

Types of Backtracking Algorithm 
Backtracking algorithms are classified into two types:

Algorithm for recursive backtracking
Non-recursive backtracking algorithm
